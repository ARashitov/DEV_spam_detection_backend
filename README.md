# FlaskExploration

This is hobby repository created to explore Flask framework for model deployment

[Original repository](https://github.com/maglili/spam-filter).

## Goal

I was curious about deployment of model as web app with automated model training and predicting, where model will be wrapped into Flask and can be utilized using `POST` method.

* Automate model training
* Wrap into Flask APP
* Enable to interact using POST
* Wrap into Docker container
* Deploy on AWS
* Interact using Jupyter
